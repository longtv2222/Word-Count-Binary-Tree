# Assignment 3

## Build instructions

```bash
make
```

It should compile all the java source files that need to be re-built. The build has been tested with GNU compiler Linux (Fedora 26).

## Usage
Program.java is my main class and should be executed after compiling with "Makefile", with no arguments.
From the Command Prompt, type "java" with a class name of the program. As example, if Asn1.java produces Asn1.class after compliation, then type as below:


```bash
java Asn1
```

If all goes well, the program will display the result. Be mindful that after running this program, there will be a popped up menu with the option to select
depending on your input.
